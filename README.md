# Assignment 1
## Self-introduction
Hi, my name is Yukari, a first-year student in the Health Data Science Program.

I am from Tokyo, Japan and moved here with my two kids and husband.
My academic background is in pharmaceutical science. I worked for a pharmaceutical company in Japan and led clinical research including developing a protocol and preliminary analysis.

Since I started learning Python a few months ago for my capstone project, I would like to learn from fundamental parts of Python to advanced skills through this class.
Furthermore, the skills of GitHub are also important to manage files, so I would be happy to learn such knowledge too. 

## List of collablrators
NA

# How to run
1. Open [excercise.ipynb](https://github.com/yukarikatsuhara/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb)
2. Clear outputs (if any)
3. Run all in a fresh virtual enviroment (no dependencies other than jupyter)

## Notes on any difficulties encountered
I could learn the following new command and need to use it more efficiently.
1. 'enumerate()' -> We can get the index.
2. 'zip()' -> We can iterate multiple lists.
3. List comprehension.
