#Intro
Hi! I'm Krish Rai a student in the Health Data Science Masters Program. Here is a link to my Making the Grade: https://github.com/kiar24/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb (Once on link open notebook on Colab or equivalent, and the code can then be run). 

Looking forward to learning Python (no prior experience) and gaining a base level of intermediate proficiency to use it. Also excited to apply it to potential clinical data based projects.

Exercism is useful to have exercises (and to learn from examples and others), 
but perhaps a set of expectations after every homework on what exact functions,etc we should know by that point might help to know if we have missed something during the homework that would be helpful to know.
