# Intro 
Hi! I'm Krish Rai a student in the Health Data Science Masters Program. 

Looking forward to learning Python (no prior experience) and gaining a base level of intermediate proficiency to use it. Also excited to apply it to potential clinical data based projects.

Exercism is useful to have exercises (and to learn from examples and others), 
but perhaps a set of expectations after every homework on what exact functions,etc we should know by that point might help to know if we have missed something during the homework that would be helpful to know.

## Instructions
### Exercise 3:
Download file and open in VS Code or equivalent. Clear outputs and ensure everything is installed (if an install is commented out at beginning), remove the # and install everything. (PS: Load_ext sql gave me a lot of trouble and wasn't working. I had to run this in Anaconda prompt: pip install ipython-sql to uninstall and reinstall. If this is a problem, try this.) Run the rest of the code and it should work.

### Exercise 2:
Updated README.md for newer assignments are also in corresponding exercise folder. For Exercise 2, please go to https://github.com/kiar24/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/2-data-munging/Completed_exercise_dirty_emnist.ipynb. Open in Colab or download file (open in VS Code). Clear virtual environment and make sure all packages are installed. (If I have commented any of the %pip install or any command has a # in block 1, please uncomment so the packages are installed. Then run each block of code for the exercise.

### Exercise 1:
Here is a link to my Making the Grade: https://github.com/kiar24/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb (Once on link open notebook on Colab or equivalent, and the code can then be run).
