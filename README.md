I am curious and distractable, squirrel!  Good guidance and direction is important to me, especially while I am a novice.  
I like to spend time exploring the outdoors both with and without me dog.  In this regard, because of my experience I like to freestyle the guidance and direction part. 
Learning to code is enjoyable, but the vast landscape of programming languages feels daunting at times.
Of particular interest to me is pondering how one might model complex processes in the humanzee: systems biology, biochemistry, biophysics, biophysical chemistry, yes please.
