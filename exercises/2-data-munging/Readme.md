# Exercise 2: Data Munging

The purpose of this exercise was to clean an intentionally dirtied set of handwritten letter image classification data.

## Instructions

To run this exercise, first make sure you have these packages installed:
string
pandas
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
emnist
hashlib 
seaborn

Once they are installed and imported, run all the code blocks. The final data frame should contain the correct labels for each image, what category the image belongs to (letter or number), the image array itself, how good the prediction score is, and whether the image belongs to the test or train dataset.
