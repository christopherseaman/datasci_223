For Exercise 2, please go to https://github.com/kiar24/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/2-data-munging/Completed_exercise_dirty_emnist.ipynb. Open in Colab or download file (open in VS Code). Clear virtual environment and make sure all pacakges are installed. (If I have commented any of the %pip install or any command has a # in block 1, please uncomment so the packages are installed. Then run each block of code for the exercise.

This assignment was much harder than the last one, I found it to be a big jump. I had to do a lot of my own research, learn commands, etc.
