# Notes on any difficulties encountered
I could learn the following new command and need to use it more efficiently.
ASCII table -> I tried to make a dictionary to create a new label at first but it was a huge burden. Using ASCII code, we can re-label correctly.
Array -> I learned how to handle an array and we need to drop it to duplicate command.
