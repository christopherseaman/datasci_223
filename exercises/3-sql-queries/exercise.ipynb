    "# Exercise: Analyzing Chinook Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation I've done:\n",
    " - Retrieve the dataset and load it\n",
    " - Load the %sql extension and point it at the database\n",
    " - Display the tables and an example query\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional steps you might take:\n",
    " - Add libraries for visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)\n",
    " - Add libraries for statistics (numpy)\n",
    " - Explore the dataset using SQL and/or pandas\n",
