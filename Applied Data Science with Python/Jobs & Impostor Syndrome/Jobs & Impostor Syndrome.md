## Q&A

- How to stand out as an applicant? (portfolio, referral, direct outreach)
- Best ways to answer technical questions or take-home projects (explain your thought process, discuss trade-offs/decisions made, acknowledge limitations of approach)
- Questions to ask the interviewers to know more about the role, day-to-day, and culture?
- Weirdest or worst interview experience?
