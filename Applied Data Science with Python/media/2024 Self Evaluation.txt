1. Describe your accomplishments and successes this performance cycle.

# Curriculum Development & Teaching Excellence

As an instructor with over two decades of professional data science experience, I've focused on bringing industry-standard practices and real-world applications into our curriculum. This year, I successfully designed and launched two foundational courses (the first ones focused on Python!) that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical skills—exactly what our students need for careers in academic research, biotech industry, and government roles. These courses were developed in direct response to student requests and have become cornerstones of our program, helping us support our growing student body.

DS-217: Introduction to Python & Data Science Tools
 - Huge initial enrollment, with 45 students completing the first offering — a testament to the course's value and appeal
 - Incorporated UCSF's HPC cluster integration and remote execution capabilities, preparing students for both academic research and industry environments
 - Brought in three guest lecturers from industry, expanding students' professional network

DS-223: Applied Data Science with Python
 - Designed and delivered advanced curriculum covering machine learning, deep learning, and practical applications
 - Integrated industry-standard tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow) with real-world examples from my experience at Atlassian, Dropbox, and 1Password
 - Built comprehensive reference materials drawing from both academic sources and industry best practices
 - Incorporated cutting-edge topics like transformers and embeddings (think ChatGPT), keeping our program competitive and current


# Program Leadership & Student Success

Capstone Program Development:
 - Joined program leadership in revising our capstone requirements to make them more flexible to varied types of research and more relevant to students' academic development
 - Mentored one of the first cohort's students to successful capstone completion, presenting her work at American Statistical Association's Joint Statistical Meeting (JSM)
 - Served as data science advisor for second cohort students, utilizing my industry network to facilitate connections with a UCSF-affiliated lab and biotech startup
 - Chaired multiple second cohort capstone committees, ensuring high standards and practical relevance
 - Established additional office hours specifically for capstone support, lending problem-solving expertise to students from outside their capstone committees 

# Research & Consulting Impact

Internal Consulting & Collaboration:
 - Conducted multiple CTSI initial consultations, applying my experience in bio- and health-tech consulting
 - Established two long-term research collaborations with Global Brain Health Initiative researchers
 - Introduced industry best practices in data system architecture and ML implementation, improving research outcomes

# Program Development & Innovation

Systematic improvements in program infrastructure:
 - Implemented standardized documentation practices based on my experience leading data science teams
 - Created reproducible workflows for course materials and assignments using GitHub (a tool students will need to know after graduating) to maintain quality while accommodating our growing student body

2. How can my supervisor help me be more successful?

# Prioritization & Program Development

There's just an amazing amount of stuff we can do. Our fledgling program needs to mature in defining roles/responsibilities, developing repeatable processes, and adopting tools to support its growth. I'd love your guidance on:
 - How should we determine what to focus on first?
 - What's the one thing that you wish we could tackle this semester?
 - What do you see as our biggest opportunity for improvement this year?
 - How can we better balance immediate teaching needs with long-term program development?


# Professional Growth & Mentorship

I'm excited about my role here but unclear about the path forward. I'd appreciate your perspective on:

Career development within UCSF's academic environment:
 - What are the options for growth in academic leadership?
 - Where could I contribute more broadly to institutional initiatives?
 - How can I get more involved in research collaborations?

Building academic networks:
 - Connecting with experienced mentors within the university
 - Finding opportunities to engage with other UCSF departments and programs
 - Understanding the academic landscape and where I might fit in long-term

3. Additional thoughts about my performance this year

Teaching these courses has been the highlight of my year. There's nothing quite like watching a student's face light up when they finally get their code to work, or seeing them confidently explain a complex concept they struggled with just weeks before. Our first cohort student presenting at JSM was amazing—she went from being nervous about public speaking to fielding tough questions like a pro.

I love that we're building something new here. Every time a student uses Python to solve a real healthcare problem, or applies what they learned in class to their research, it reminds me why we started this program. The late-night debugging sessions, the "aha!" moments in office hours, even the frustrating days when nothing seems to work—it's all worth it when students start seeing themselves as real data scientists.

I'm excited to keep growing with the program. We're figuring things out as we go, but seeing our students succeed makes me confident we're on the right track. I want to keep making our courses better, keep pushing our students to tackle harder problems, and keep helping them discover what they're capable of.
