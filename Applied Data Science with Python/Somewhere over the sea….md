# Takeaways

## Intent

As the only course dedicated to Python in the program (and with very little guidance), the goals were:

- Cover the basics very quickly
    - Working with Python, Jupyter, VS Code, and GitHub
- Spend 1-2 weeks visiting common applications in research & industry
    - Import data and clean it
    - Utilize existing code & models
    - Write basic models of our own

## What went well…

- **We covered a lot:** Got through a lot of material quickly, with hands-on work form students to demonstrate capability
- **With a practical focus:** Focus on applied skills, helpful for getting through technical interviews and working in industry
- **And maybe it helped?** You all have so many different kinds of projects, most supporting future/on-going Capstone research. Validation that covering many methods quickly was a good idea, given the lack of other courses in Python?

## What could have gone better…

- **Fundamentals:** There was no course content before this covering basics of Python (~1 semester course) or working from the command prompt (1-2 lectures)
- **GitHub:** Spent too much time with git conflicts
- **Balance of theory and code:** Some lectures did this well (SQL) while others needed improvement (Classification)

## Next steps…

1. **Reviews:**
    1. **Please rate this (imperfect) course highly if you enjoyed this imperfect course and would like to see more like it or more from me**
    2. Give feedback directly to the program directors (or myself) regarding what you’d want to see more of or done differently
2. **Program recommendations:** I have been asked to provide feedback on the program. _Please reach out to me if you’d like to give input on my recommendations_, but also please give feedback directly to the program directors. So far I plan to include:
    1. **Student preparation:** Students this year have been better prepared and have clearer goals than in the first year of the program
    2. **Fundamentals:** Early in the first year there should be an opportunity for students to get the basics of: R, Python, GitHub, Markdown, VS Code, RStudio, and other common tools
    3. **Language-agnostic coursework:** Coursework should be completable in either R or Python; lectures may focus on one over the other but, at minimum, links and references for both should be provided
    4. **GitHub:** GitHub is currently the way data scientists collaborate in industry. GitHub Education provides a better model than vanilla GitHub for coursework, allowing assignment submissions and pedagogical repo’s in a manner that would avoid git conflicts.
    5. **Teaching assistants:** We lucked out with Emily, but we only got her after there were no second year students available to TA. Ideally, someone who did well in the class this year should (if willing) TA next year.
    6. **Capstone mentorship:** Individual advisors may not be equipped to provide both subject-matter expertise as well as technical expertise. This gap should be acknowledged and planned for.
